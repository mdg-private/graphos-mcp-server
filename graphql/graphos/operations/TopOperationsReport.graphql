# This operation returns a list of operations for a specified $graphId and $graphVariant between the specified ISO timestamps ($from and $to). The from timestamp must be within the last 549 days, the to timestamp must be at least 6 hours from the current time, and the duration between 'from' and 'to' must not exceed 31 days. The number of results is defined by the $limit param. The order direction (`ASCENDING` or `DESCENDING`) is specified by the $orderByDirection param. The results can be filtered to specific clients or client versions using $filterClientNames and $filterClientVersions.
