docker image pull ghcr.io/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server:v0.2.0
```

## Set up graph

An Apollo MCP Server must know the schema of GraphQL API it supports. You can use either [the `--schema` or `--uplink` option](/apollo-mcp-server/command-reference#options) to provide the schema. If using `--schema` option, it can be either an API or supergraph schema.

The schema is required for three main purposes:

1. **Tool Descriptions**: The schema provides type information used to generate tool descriptions. You can override these descriptions by adding comments to your operation files.
1. **Input Validation**: The schema is used to translate GraphQL input types into JSON Schema, ensuring that AI models provide correctly formatted inputs.
1. **Introspection Support**: If you enable the `--introspection` option, the schema is used to provide information about available types and operations to AI models.

## Define GraphQL operations for tools

You can manually define the GraphQL operations that are exposed by Apollo MCP Server as MCP tools. You can define these operations using:

- Operation files
- Persisted query manifests
- GraphOS-managed persisted queries

Alternatively, you can let an AI model read your graph schema via GraphQL introspection and have it determine the available operations.

### From operation files

An operation file is a `.graphql` file containing a single GraphQL operation.

<CodeColumns cols={2}>

```graphql title="Example operation GetForecast"
query GetForecast($coordinate: InputCoordinate!) {
  forecast(coordinate: $coordinate) {
    detailed
  }
}
```

```graphql title="Example operation GetWeatherData"
query GetAllWeatherData($coordinate: InputCoordinate!, $state: String!) {
  forecast(coordinate: $coordinate) {
    detailed
  }
  alerts(state: $state) {
    severity
    description
    instruction
  }
}
```

</CodeColumns>

The `--operations` option of the MCP Server provides it with a list of operation files. For each operation file you provide, the MCP Server creates an MCP tool that calls the corresponding GraphQL operation.

The `--operations` option can also be used to specify a directory. All files with a `.graphql` extension in the directory will be loaded as operations.

Files and directories specified with `--operations` will be hot reloaded. When specifying a file, the MCP tool will be updated when the file contents are modified. When specifying a directory, operations exposed as MCP tools will be updated when files are added, modified, or removed from the directory.

### From persisted query manifests

Apollo MCP Server supports reading GraphQL operations from Apollo-formatted [persisted query manifest](/graphos/platform/security/persisted-queries#manifest-format) files.

You can set the persisted query manifest file for the MCP Server by using the `--manifest` option. The MCP Server supports hot reloading of persisted query manifests, so changes to manifests are applied without restarting.

An example manifest is available in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server/tree/main/graphql/weather/persisted_queries).

<ExpansionPanel title="Example command using --manifest">

From the root of a local MCP Server repo, run the `apollo-mcp-server` binary with the example persisted query manifest, `graphql/weather/persisted_queries/apollo.json`:

```sh showLineNumbers=false
apollo-mcp-server \
  --directory <absolute path to this local repo> \
  --schema graphql/weather/api.graphql \
  --header "apollographql-client-name:my-web-app" \
  --manifest graphql/weather/persisted_queries/apollo.json
```

</ExpansionPanel>

### From GraphOS-managed persisted queries

For graphs managed by GraphOS, Apollo MCP Server can get operations by reading persisted queries from GraphOS. The MCP Server uses Apollo Uplink to access the persisted queries.

To use GraphOS persisted queries, you must:
- Set `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` and `APOLLO_KEY` environment variables for a GraphOS graph
- Run Apollo MCP Server with the `--uplink` option

<Tip>

Use a [contract variant](/graphos/platform/schema-management/delivery/contracts/overview) with a persisted query list associated with that variant, so you can control what AI can consume from your graph. [Learn more](/apollo-mcp-server/best-practices#use-contract-variants-to-control-ai-access-to-graphs).

</Tip>


```sh title="Example command using GraphOS-managed persisted queries"
apollo-mcp-server \
  --directory <absolute path to this git repo> \
  --schema graphql/weather/api.graphql \
  --header "apollographql-client-name:my-web-app" \
  --uplink
```

The MCP Server supports hot reloading of GraphOS-managed persisted queries, so it can automatically pick up changes from GraphOS without restarting.

If you register a persisted query with a specific client name instead of `null`, you must configure the MCP Server to send the necessary header indicating the client name to the router.

Use the `--header` option when running the MCP Server to pass the header to the router. The default name of the header expected by the router is `apollographql-client-name`. To use a different header name, configure `telemetry.apollo.client_name_header` in router YAML configuration.


### From schema introspection

For use cases where not all operations can be pre-defined, Apollo MCP Server supports tool creation based on introspection of the graph schema. This allows AI agents to explore a graph and execute operations dynamically.

To enable these schema-aware tools, run the MCP Server with the `--introspection` option, which exposes two new tools:

* `introspect` - returns information about schema types
* `execute` - executes an operation on the GraphQL endpoint

The MCP client can use these tools to provide schema information to the model and its context window, and allow the model to execute GraphQL operations based on that schema.

<Tip>

Use a [contract variant](/graphos/platform/schema-management/delivery/contracts/overview) so you can control the parts of your graph that AI can introspect. [Learn more](/apollo-mcp-server/best-practices#use-contract-variants-to-control-ai-access-to-graphs)

## Deploying a container

Apollo MCP Server is available as a standalone docker container. Container images are downloadable using
the image `ghcr.io/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server`.

By default, the container expects all schema and operation files to be present in the `/data` folder within the container
and that clients will use SSE transport on container port 5000.

An example `docker run` command that runs the MCP Server for the space dev example:

```sh showLineNumbers=false
docker run \
  -it --rm \
  --name apollo-mcp-server \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  -v $PWD/graphql/TheSpaceDevs:/data \
  ghcr.io/apollographql/apollo-mcp-server:latest \
    --schema api.graphql \
    --operations operations/ \
    --endpoint https://thespacedevs-production.up.railway.app/
```

## Debugging with MCP Inspector

[MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) is a debugging tool for MCP servers.

### Debug locally over stdio transport

You can inspect a local Apollo MCP Server by running it with MCP Inspector.

1. Run the MCP Server with Inspector:

```sh
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector \
  target/debug/apollo-mcp-server \
  --directory <absolute path to this git repo> \
  --schema graphql/weather/api.graphql \
  --operations graphql/weather/operations/forecast.graphql graphql/weather/operations/alerts.graphql graphql/weather/operations/all.graphql
```

<ExpansionPanel title="Example output">

```sh showLineNumbers=false disableCopy=true
Starting MCP inspector...
‚öôÔ∏è Proxy server listening on port 6277
üîç MCP Inspector is up and running at http://127.0.0.1:6274 üöÄ
```
</ExpansionPanel>

1. In a browser, go to the URL returned by Inspector, then click **Connect** and **List Tools**. You should see the tools for the operations you provided.

### Debug over the Streamable HTTP transport

When running the MCP Server over the Streamable HTTP transport, you can run MCP Inspector as follows.

1. Start the MCP Server in Streamable HTTP mode:

<Tip>

You can also deploy the server as a container using the instructions in [Deploying a Container](#deploying-a-container).

</Tip>

```sh
target/debug/apollo-mcp-server \
  --directory <absolute path to this git repo> \
  --http-port 5000 \
  --schema graphql/weather/api.graphql \
  --operations graphql/weather/operations/forecast.graphql graphql/weather/operations/alerts.graphql graphql/weather/operations/all.graphql
```

1. Start the MCP Inspector:

```sh
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

1. In a browser, go to the URL returned by Inspector, then fill in the details:
    - **Transport Type**: Select `Streamable HTTP`
    - **URL**: Enter `http://127.0.0.1:5000/mcp`, where the port must match the `--http-port` option

1. Click **Connect** and **List Tools**. You should see the tools for the operations you provided.

### Custom scalars configuration

You can specify a custom scalars configuration JSON file to map a custom scalar to a [JSON schema type](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type). The JSON file is an object with custom scalar names as keys and JSON schema types as values:
```json
{
   "MyCustomScalar": { "type": "string" }
}
```
Other than JSON schema type, an overriding description can also be provided. In the following example the description provided in the schema, `scalar description` would get overridden by the description found in the custom scalar configuration file, `override description`
```graphql
"""scalar description"""
scalar MyCustomScalar
```
```json
{
   "MyCustomScalar": { "type": "string", "description":  "override description" }
}
```
